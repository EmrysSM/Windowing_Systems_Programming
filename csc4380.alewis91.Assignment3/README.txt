README.md for CSC4380 Assignment 3

The program is designed to automatically input encrypt the text typed in the decrypted text area, and automatically decrypt 
the text typed in the encrypted text area. There is also a button that the user can press to decrypt and encrypt, and the button 
would be useful if text is pasted into the area instead of typed, because the automatic encryption/decryption is based on 
the event of keys being typed. I have noticed that if I type too quickly, the events do not respond quick enough and the 
encrypted/decrypted text gets thrown off some, but if I type at a moderate speed everything is encrypted correctly. Even if something
gets thrown off due to typing speed, if you press the encrypt/decrypt button, it will show the correct text.
